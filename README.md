# PythonBST
A school project where we had to do two versions of the same Binary Search Tree in two different languages. One of the languages I chose was python. The program generates 20 random numbers ranging from 1-100 and inserts them into a tree, then outputs the tree. Then, gives the user the instruction to select a node that is not a child, which is made clear by displaying the child nodes in a list along with all of the nodes in another, to delete a node. The program then prints the tree after deletion. For the very end of the assignment, the program will generate one random number between 1-100, and inserts it into the tree. The program outputs the tree afterward.
